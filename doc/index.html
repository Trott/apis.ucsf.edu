        <h2>APIs.ucsf.edu JavaScript Base Object</h2>
        <p class="lead">JavaScript APIs hosted at APIs.ucsf.edu reside in an object in the global namespace called <code>UCSF</code>.</p>
        <p>The base object may be loaded in a web page like so:</p> <pre>&lt;script src="http://apis.ucsf.edu/jsapi">&lt;/script></pre>
        <p>In practice, however, you would almost never load the base object like that. Instead, you would request all the other code required for your APIs at the same time. For example, you could get the base object (<code>UCSF</code>) and the Person Search API code (<code>UCSF.Person</code>) like so:</p> <pre>&lt;script src="http://apis.ucsf.edu/jsapi?person">&lt;/script></pre> 
        <p>Or if you wanted to get the Shuttle API code as well (<code>UCSF.Shuttle</code>), you could get it all with one HTTP request:</p> <pre>&lt;script src="http://apis.ucsf.edu/jsapi?person&amp;amp;shuttle">&lt;/script></pre>
        <p>There is some basic scaffolding inside the <code>UCSF</code> object for CORS/XHR support and a Flash-based polyfill fallback for CORS/XHR for Internet Explorer 7 (IE7).</p>
        <p><small>If you're wondering why we bother with IE7, that's an excellent question. For better or worse, there is a substantial IE7 installed base at the UCSF Medical Center. While we don't want to go too crazy supporting obsolete technology with a disappearing market share, we nonetheless want these APIs to work on all computers at UCSF. This means supporting IE7. (And yes, IE7 support more than triples the size of the base JavaScript object. <i>C'est la vie.</i>)</small></p>
